I've created a beautiful and modern New Year's countdown with all the requested features:

Clean, Modern Design:

Gradient background with a semi-transparent glass-morphism effect
Smooth animations and transitions
Large background year display
Decorative sparkle elements
Responsive Features:

Mobile-first approach with responsive grid layout
Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes
Readable typography at all viewport widths
Technical Implementation:

Efficient React hooks for state management
Proper time calculations with automatic year updates
Leading zeros in time display
Smooth loading transition with animated clock icon
Performance optimized with minimal re-renders
Additional Features:

PT Sans Narrow font for clean typography
Backdrop blur effects for modern glass-morphism
Animated sparkle elements for visual interest
Smooth color transitions and animations
The countdown is now running and will automatically update every second. It will also automatically adjust the target year when the new year begins.
